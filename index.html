        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>Hey, I'm Jay. I'm 15 and I go to Hutt Valley High School this year.</p>
        <p>I've always loved technology and am excited to spend another year doing DTEC. Also very excited that we're going to do a course on AI as well.</p>
        <p>Other than that, I like speedcubing, gaming, chess</p>
        <p>I really love this band Imagine Dragons, they're awesome! You probably already know that about me though given you've had a year with me already.</p>
