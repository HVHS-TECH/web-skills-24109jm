        <p>Imagine Dragons are an American Alternative Rock band known for hits, such as Believer, Thunder, Radioactive, and many, many more.</p>
        <p>I discovered Imagine Dragons almost 3 years ago and have been obsessed ever since. I love songs such as Lonely, Battle Cry, Eyes Closed, Fire In These Hills, Destroyed (Demo), and litterally everything else they've ever put out</p>

        <h3>Speecubing</h3>
        <p>Speedcubing is the act of solving a Rubik's Cube (or Speedcube) as fast as you can.</p>
        <p>I used to compete in this, you can find me profile <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2022MCEL02">here</a>. Keep in mind I haven't competed in a while and therefore these averages are outdated.</p>
        <p>Currently, I average 21 seconds at the 3x3 (the default cube). My favourite cube is the SQ-1, which I average 45s at.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>Gaming has always been a fun hobby for me. I've enjoyed it for as long as I can remember.</p>
        <p>I haven't really played as much recently as I used to. Currently, I don't play many games at all. Only Fortnite and Clash Royale.</p>
        <p>To be honest, I'm actually not sure at all why I like gaming. I kinda just do it, find it fun, and that's it. Theres nothing spesific I love about it, I just love it.</p>
