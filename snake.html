        <h3>Snake</h3>
          <p>I'm done and I got bored so I thought I would try to code the snake game. My experience with JavaScript code is very limited so this is my first time making something this complicated.</p>
          <p>If I am being totally honest I would never do this on an assesment as I used AI to teach me but I really didn't understand, so though I did write it all myself, I used AI so much to the point where it is practicfally AI generated. I just want to make that clear. (I'ts also pretty broken)</p>
