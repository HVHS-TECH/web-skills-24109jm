        <h3>Top Grades</h3>
        <p>It is a goal of mine in DTEC this year to get top grades in every assesment.</p>
        <p>I understand that I may not and am ok with that, but I will put in as much effort as I can, and I expect at least one top mark in one of my assesments minimum, or else I will be very dissapointed in myself.</p>

        <h3>Create High Quality Work</h3>
        <p>Regardless of the grades that I recieve, I would like to produce work that I am actually proud of.</p>
        <p>This website is an example of that work. So far, it is looking really nice thanks to heavy CSS, with a colour changing background and a sleek vibe.</p>
        <p>All my work must be authentic and mine. This means though I may use AI to help me learn, every piece of code was written by myself, not by ChatGPT.</p>

        <h3>Have Fun</h3>
        <p>I've always liked technology. I don't want to sound cliché but I just want to have fun this year and experiment with the tech in every way I can :).</p>
